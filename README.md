# Song-Player-WebD
This project has been developed as a solo venture by Reuben Mark Elias, student of DTU.

1) The music player has been equipped with a neat looking UI. It provides the user with all the essential functionalities charactersitic of a well designed music player.
2) Although, some songs have been hardcoded into directory, the javascript only needs to be changed a little to accomodate JSON. The player can then be easily linked using an API, to import any song that needs to be played.
